# Windows Domain Controller
## Builds a Windows Server 2022 Azure Edition VM with the AD DS and DNS roles installed.  
The default size is a B2ms, which is usually considered the best option for a standard domain controller.  
If you will be running additional roles or software on this VM, it is recommended to bump up to size to a B4ms.  
Don't forget to get a reservation if you are leaving the VM online all the time.
